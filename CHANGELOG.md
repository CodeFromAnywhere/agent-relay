**ðŸŽ‰ Now I can potentially already use all agents inside of actionschema!**

# Improve sts with custom agents

âœ… Ensure `/agent.json` returns an actual assistant JSON!

âœ… Copy repo to `deepgram-twilio-agent-demo` and leave as-is there.

âœ… Get param `?agentUrl=xxx&deepgramToken=xxx` in url

âœ… Use that deepgram token instead of hosted secret.

âœ… Try fetching `agentUrl` (if not available, use default config)

âœ… The instructions can be mapped into this config!

âœ… Make an assistant that uses tools in the 'platform.openai.com'

âœ… Ensure syncing agents works (agents all end up in the db). Seems broken.

âœ… Fetch it in `agent.actionschema.com/asst_gwokTex8ADkoZTVWMz604vHs/details.json` and confirm it shows itself including functions and any other settings.

# Test STS with new setup

âœ… First refactor agents

âœ… Put all info we have into the stuff and see what we need to present in `details`

Fix these node compatibility issues of cloudflare

âœ… Deploy wrangler successfully

âœ… Use this as URL in twilio

âœ… Call it and confirm! Now every GPT can be used via a phonenumber (via my token) simply by providing a URL in Twilio.

**ðŸŽ‰ Now people login with openai and can speak sts with all their agents! ^^**

# Whatsapp Client

âœ… Can I transform the `receiveWhatsappTwilio` thing so it must contain the `?agentUrl=xxx&Authorization=xxx` and correctly responds?

âœ… Should call `/message` endpoint

âœ… Do the same for all other things Twilio serves, basically creating a Twilio+GPT Link.

# HTML STS Client

âœ… `index.ts:99` --> Fix JSONParseError

âœ… Setup Local Tunnel in `npm run dev`: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-local-tunnel/ <-- NEEDS A FIXED URL TO PUT IN A PHONE NUMBER

âœ… Get a Whatsapp Phone Number and talk to Wijnand AI that is in dev...

âœ… https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/js-example-client

âœ… The websocket is now made available through a URL in twilio containing all info - without there being a datastore. However, it can be great for PR if we allow people to find agents and either chat with them (via opengpts) or speak (via html client).

âœ… Render a button on the agent that opens the browser client for talking to it through websocket (requires user to fill a deepgram token)

# Self Control

Adding tools to call someone or to hang up the call are super cool for twilio calls. Let's try this out!

In `/message` a tool that would change the tools to another agent would also be super interesting.
